Ferdinando Maria Meinrado Francesco Pascale Rosario Carulli (9 February 1770 – 17 February 1841) was an Italian composer for classical guitar and the author of the influential Méthode complète pour guitare ou lyre, op. 27 (1810), which contains music still used by student guitarists today. He wrote a variety of works for classical guitar, including numerous solo and chamber works and several concertos. He was an extremely prolific writer, composing over 400 works for the instrument.

Although not very well-known today, Ferdinando Carulli belonged, in his heyday, to the leading guitarists, to be named in one breath together with Mauro Giuliani, Anton Diabelli or Johann Kaspar Mertz. He was born in Naples, Italy, but moved as a young man to Paris, where he celebrated many a triumph as a saloon musician.
